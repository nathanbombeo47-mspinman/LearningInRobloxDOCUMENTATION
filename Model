Models are container objects, meaning they group objects together.
They are best used to hold collections of BaseParts and have a number of functions that extend their functionality.

Note that Models do not have PrimaryPart set by default. If you are creating a model that needs to be acted upon by physics, you should manually set this property in Studio or within a script.
If the primary part is not set, the pivot will remain at the same location in world space, even if parts within the model are moved.

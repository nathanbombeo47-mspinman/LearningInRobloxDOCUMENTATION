Here are the direct links to each class in the Roblox documentation:


🛠️ The "Building Blocks" (Physical)
These are the things you can see, move, and touch.

Part – The most basic physical object.

Model – A folder for parts that has a "center" (PrimaryPart). Essential for characters and cars.

Vector3 – How you describe Position and Size (X, Y, Z).

CFrame – How you describe Position + Rotation. (Think of it as Vector3 with a "look direction").

📜 The "Brains" (Scripting)
The only three places your code actually lives.

Script – Runs on the Server (handles things everyone sees, like scores or the map).

LocalScript – Runs on the Player's Computer (handles things only they see, like their UI or their own camera).

ModuleScript – A "Book of Functions" that other scripts can read from.

👥 The "Human" Side (Characters)
Player – The person behind the screen (lives in game.Players).

Humanoid – The "engine" inside a character that makes them walk, jump, and have health.

🖼️ The "Interface" (UI)
ScreenGui – The invisible container on your screen.

TextButton – A button the player clicks.

UDim2 – The "Vector3" of UI. It’s how you set size and position for buttons (Scale and Offset).

📡 The "Radio" (Communication)
RemoteEvent – The bridge. How a LocalScript tells a Script to do something (like "I clicked the buy button").

Why did I erase the others?

Instance / BasePart / DataModel: These are "Parents." You use their features automatically when you use a Part. You don't need to study the "blueprint" if you're already building with the "bricks."

RemoteFunction / BindableEvent: These are more specific versions of RemoteEvents. You don't need them yet.


All set! 🚀
